                            <p>I made this website as a project. I have just started learning web development and I wanted to make my own website so I created one. This website has some basic info of how my sophmore year of college has been going. </p>
                            <p> I have given a summary of each month that I have already completed. If the month is in the future then I give a sentence or two of how I expect that month to go. I will update this web page as the months go on. I hope to have a good year and I hope you enjoy my website.</p>
